On this blog, you will not find literary masterpieces. I know, very disappointing. Instead, you will come across ramblings and hopefully a few interesting posts, though I am sure those will remain fairly rare. I have no idea how much time this blog will devour out of my day, but I am sure that it will be a lot.

I enjoy competitive programming and currently (as of writing this) am in USACO Silver. I also am a AIME qualifer and I hope to keep that "title".

My personal website is located at https://ds12a.github.io/. Check it out.
