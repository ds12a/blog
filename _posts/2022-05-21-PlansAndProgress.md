Yay. I have a blog now. I'll admit it looks fairly empty and that I have a few things to work out. For example:

- Why are the arrows for the navlinks at the bottom of this post not gray?
- Why are the links not next to each other?
- How do I add links to the top navbar?
- Most importantly: What do I write about?

Most of those issues are because I am using a template that I don't really understand. But I really didn't have the time to write a blog myself. 

Since yesterday when I started this blog, I have made some progress on making this blog a bit "better". Comments are now supported, but you need a Github account. I have customized it just a bit so it's not quite as templated.

That all for now.
