Perfect! This is exactly what I had imagined when I first envisioned Codespaces. It looks just like VS Code.  Also, if I'm not mistaken, it's also using my favorite theme: Github Dark High Contrast!!! The upload feature makes it easy to add files to repos and greatly sped up the writing of this post. Overall, I could not expect a better developer experience, especially with little setup. The upload feature makes it easy to add files to repos and greatly sped up the writing of this post.

A massive thanks to those at Github who made Github Codespaces available!
