The math contest is done. I did far better than I thought I would. 

There were 6 questions, *not 5!!!* The first question caused me to dive into a 20-minute panic. The second one restored my confidence in myself, which was soon destroyed by the fourth question and restored once again by the fifth question. Part b of the third question still bothers me, as does the first question. My construction for the fourth question is somewhat iffy. I'm still worried that there were multiple answers to the fifth problem, and I only found one. My post-contest panic may or may not be worse than my precontest panic, now that my answers are submitted and unchangeable. Plus, I really want to know my score, but the results haven't been posted yet. I hope it's out within a day.

It was distractions galore while test-taking. First was the door, which rattled *every single time it was used* which was often. Then, it was middle schoolers who simply could not keep still after turning in their test *20 minutes into a **3 hour** test*. The pencil tapping really got to me.

All in all, it was a nice contest. The problems were interesting and thoughtful. It was wonderful that they could host this competition and that they continued to host it after being interrupted by the pandemic (unlike a *certain* competition that I wanted to try). Greatly appreciate that.

*Update (5/23/22 1:36 pm): Score still not out. The website hasn't even been updated to show that the contest has already occurred.*
