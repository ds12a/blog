The contest starts at 10 am today, which is about 2 hours from now. Precontest panic is beginning to set in. There are 5 questions on the 3 hour exam. Here are some scenarios of what could happen:

- I completely fail and solve 0 problems
- I near completely fail and solve 1 problem
- I do very poorly and do 2 problems
- I do poorly and do 3 problems
- I do good and do 4 problems
- I do amazingly and do 5 problems (which will probably not happen)

I think I should be able to do poorly and solve 3 problems. The thing is, this contest is more about logic rather than mathematical ability, though I suppose logic plays a major role in mathematical ability. I have proven to myself numerous times that I can't think logically. Hopefully this precontest panic is making me think pessimisticly.
