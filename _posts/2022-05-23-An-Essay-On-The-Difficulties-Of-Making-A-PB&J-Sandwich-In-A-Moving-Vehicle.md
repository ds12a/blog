What could possibly be difficult about making a PB&J sandwich in a moving vehicle?

Any difficulties that may arise depend on the vehicle one is riding during this process. This post will focus on the challenges that a car may produce. Here, we shall look into what challenges a driver may encounter making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and what challenges a passenger would encounter.

## The Passenger(s):

The passenger has the advantage of being able to utilize both hands in this process without too much risk. The process of making a PB&J sandwich on a moving car is rather similar to the usual procedure. The biggest issue here is the fact that you, the bread, the peanut butter, the jam, and everything else are accelerating and decelerating. Thus, the passenger must be very careful when moving to avoid hitting things. The passenger must be sure to avoid slathering themself with peanut butter or jelly. The jolts caused by the road the passenger experiences pose the largest issue during this process.

## The Driver:

It must be first stated that this activity is extremely dangerous for the driver to engage in when the vehicle is in operation. To begin with, the process of making a PP&J sandwich is very much a two-handed activity. Driving is usually a two-handed activity. This leaves no safe way to make a sandwich. But let's assume that Bob is a very daring (and somewhat unintelligent) person. 

Bob first must manage to obtain the bread. This can be accomplished with one hand remaining on the steering wheel and his other hand reaching blindly for the bread. This would clearly be a messy process. Now that the bread is in his possession and on the dashboard, Bob shifts his focus to the peanut butter. He grabs a jar and unscrews the lid through the combined effort of his hands and his legs. This process is repeated with the jar of jam. When Bob is done with that, he uses a utensil to scoop out the peanut butter and spread it out on a slice of bread. 

But here he encounters a major problem! The bread sticks to the peanut butter which sticks to his utensil. Many things could happen here. Bob may not notice that the bread is following his utensil back and the bread falls onto Bob's clothes, slathering it with delicious (but rather unsightly) peanut butter. The same process arises with the jam. But should Bob succeed in this perilous process, he is awarded a not-very-well-made sandwich!

## Summary:

It's not a pleasant experience making PB&J on a car driving down the highway at 70 mph (especially with construction). I assure you of this.
