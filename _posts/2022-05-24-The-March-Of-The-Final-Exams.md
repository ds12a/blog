As final exams march closer, my level of panic grows. My first (and probably most difficult) exams are next week. I have basically done *zero* preperation. After that, I have the rest of my exams the following week. The only sure thing about the next 2 weeks is that they will not be fun.

## Distractions, distractions, and more distractions

I realize that I should probably be studying instead of writing this post, but I am distracted really easily. This blog is yet another distraction that has recently distracted my attention. There is also my website, which I have given up on remodeling, a web version of a math project, and my compulsive checking of the math olympiad website I recently participated in (as of writing this, the results *still* have not been posted). Until these distractions are reduced, I don't think I can focus on studying.

### For the Win

Oh, and I can't forget *For the Win* on AOPS. The problems are usually easy, but that's when you have ample time, which you never have. I have never been very fast at mental math, not to mention that I also read rather slowly.

## Study Plans?

Yes, I could lay out what I could study every day to ensure that I don't have to cram it all in the night before, but I'll probably not even follow the plan that I make. I suppose I'll just go over the material over time and perhaps do some practice problems.

## Conclusion

Let \(d\) be the number of days before exams begin. Let \(P\) represent my panic level, measured as the percent of my sanity that I have lost as a result. Then, we have

$$ P(d) = {100 \over d} $$
