It has been one week since I started this blog. I'm actually pretty surprised that I've managed to keep it going for a whole week. When I started this last week, I expected that I would write some dumb post every week or so. But I've pretty much written something every day. I hope this trend doesn't continue. Why?

## Exams literally start next week!

I should really be studying for my exams rather than tapping away at my blog. I should probably start studying, like now. Forget about the rest of this post. I'm just going to end it here. Didn't I tell you not to expect literary masterpieces?
