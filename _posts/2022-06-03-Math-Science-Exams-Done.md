I have finally completed my two hardest final exams: calculus and biology. 

## Calculus Exam

My calculus exam went well and I was able to solve the problems with a certain level of confidence. Of course, this was how I felt about my calculus midterm, where I performed far lower than I anticipated. I certainly hope that this time will be different.

## Biology Exam

This was the exam I most dreaded. Who doesn't dread a 220-question exam? There were a few questions where I was somewhat unsure of the answer. My biggest regret here was not studying the spelling of various terms. I just realized that I completely slaughtered the spelling of one of the terms :(

It was a little sad that the school year came to an end, but I cannot say that I'm not excited for the summer.
