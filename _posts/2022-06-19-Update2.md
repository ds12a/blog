It's been a while since my last post (10 days). Here's some of what happened since:

## Math olympiad prize

I learned that I got 2nd place at that math olympiad back on 5/22! It took a while, but I finally recieved my prizes for the competition: a book and a certificate.

## Survived exams

I did pretty well on my final exams. It feels so much better without the weight of exams.

## A few other things

I don't feel like writing detailed descriptions for the rest of what I did so I'll just list them:

- Another attempt at working on geometry problems (and maybe enjoying them)
- Updating my programming language knowledge (why do languages change so quickly??)
- Wondering why the weather is so hot in *June* (95+ degrees F)
- Some more USACO's
- Reading
- Doing nothing and staring blankly
- Returning to robotics

## Upcoming

**A LOT**

## Plans?

What's a plan? Oh, that thing where you want to get something done? I guess working on my programming skills and math along with trying to enjoy the summer. I might even renovate my website.
